Convertr Code test

This test is a chance for you to impress us with your coding skills and how you approach a

blank canvas.

an hour. If you can add some of the nice to haves, then great.

You can use what ever you want to get the job done in the right, and you can google what

ever you need.

You will get a chance to explain your code at the end and tell us why you have done it in this

way.
