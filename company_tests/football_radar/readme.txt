Task:2
We are interested in finding out which teams were the most profitable to bet on during the previous Premier League season (2009/10).

I have attached a CSV file containing data about this season.

Your task is to write a PHP script that calculates and displays the profit or loss I would have made for each team if I had bet Â£10 with Bet365 on that team to win every game.

Note: you may find these columns in the CSV file useful:
HomeTeam = Home Team
AwayTeam = Away Team
FTHG = Full Time Home Team Goals
FTAG = Full Time Away Team Goals
B365H = Bet365 home win odds
B365D = Bet365 draw odds
B365A = Bet365 away win odds

So output is a list of all teams with the profit/loss next to each team.
